summary: Why Plume is really called 3 sigma.
---

I've often said we are both the luckiest and the unluckiest team in crypto. We were early to the RWA narrative after almost going down the BTC L2 path, we somehow assembled the perfect early stage team for what we were doing, and we have been able to navigate the market incredibly well relatively speaking. We've also seen regulation come in our favor like never before.

On the other end, one of our traders always talks about 3 sigma events. And in this case, we have been one of the unluckiest.

When we took the token out, Trump launched a token the day before and fucked the market. Then the day after we launched the Apollo and YZi News, we had ww3 rumors that dumped the market. Then our cofounder killed himsefl and ruined our momentum. After that all the repair work that we had done with Binance got completely fucked. Then we finally got rate cuts, but nothing happened. Then everyone was betting on a strong October, and we got 10/10. And then we finally got Upbit, and that was in the face of historical lows on liquidity. And so relatively speaking, we've also had the worst luck known to man.

The distinction between us and other companies is that we've never felt sorry for ourselves being in this situation. At the end of the day, nobody gives a shit. You have to do your thing and continue playing like a champion. And so the thing that we have been able to play well is that anybody we've been able to stay very nimble and just focus on trying to make the best of the situation and do what we can. That's why we took the token out in 2 weeks. That's why we've been grinding on the mainnet and all of the things that we are doing.

And so that is the short story. As a founder, you have to prepare for everything because it is true that the world changes very quickly and if you are not around for the ride, then you might not be cut out for this life.
