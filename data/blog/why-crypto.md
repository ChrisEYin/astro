I find that I spend a lot of time talking to my web2 friends convincing them of crypto. For an industry that prides itself on disruption, it still surprises me how safe most founders & investors still play it.

Making money is all about alpha. Where is there requisite opportunity and not enough people serving it.

Back then I knew that enterprise software was cooked. And it was clear to me that AI was going to take off. But it was also clear to me that crypto had a future and not only had future, but was incredibly mispriced.

And that is the opportunity. Joining something that has momentum early and then riding that wave is the best way to grow. And that's why crypto is still the best move for most people.

Today crypto is still super scammy, the products are mostly not real, the users are largely just farmers, and tokens are still legally quite grey. But it's also clear from anyone who has used crypto and also just following local regulation that this is changing quickly.

And so being early to a scene is quite simple. You have to join when things look crazy. Otherwise it's too obvious and the alpha is gone and gets competed away.

And so when you look at things like AI, it's obviously still a thing, but there are too many dollars flowing in and there are far too many people playing in that field. There are still an abundance of opportunities there, but the money gets competed away quickly.

A more obvious one is classic enterprise VC or even just VC in general. Most VC's didn't understand what was going on and didn't realize that they were simply the most evolved dinosaur. Alive and kicking, but would ultimately die.

And so that's not only how to think about positioning youself but also how to make money. Believe in the mess. Believe in crypto.
