I find myself saying this more often so I thought I’d write it down. There’s a story from the book [Art & Fear](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0961454733/?tag=codihorr-20 [1]) by David Bayles and Ted Orland about a ceramics teacher. The story is:

> “The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality.
>
> His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot – albeit a perfect one – to get an “A”.
>
> Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work – and learning from their mistakes – the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.”

I’ve written about [this concept](http://www.chrisyin.com/blog/2019/01/06/peeling-the-onion/ [2]) before but think it’s super important and under appreciated. If you want to learn to do something well, create incredibly small feedback loops and just run through them over and over.

It seems quite obvious. The more you do something, the better at it you’ll be. So if it's so obvious, why don’t people do it? 

The simple answer is it’s hard. But more specifically, I think it’s because a lot of people aren’t able to throw away their own work. Implicit in the statement “make 100 pots” is that you have to throw away 99 of them. That can be a tough hurdle for a lot of people to get over. But once you get past the first few, the rest are easy.

So if you want to be great at something — make 100 pots.
