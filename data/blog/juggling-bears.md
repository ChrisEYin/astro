There’s a Naval PandoMonthly from back in the day and something he said there I have always remembered. I can’t find exactly where it is in the video and I'm too lazy to find it, but at some point he talks about the type of people who stand out in the world. He says something like — “nobody cares about a bear, nobody cares about someone juggling, but a bear juggling people will watch.”

I think about this a lot. And have noticed that many of the greats are these ‘juggling bears’.

An obvious one I think about is Lil Nas X. Gay country rapper. A mixture of before him unrelated things now woven together in a perfect package. You could also factor in Tiktok as a platform that helped him reach this new audience. But let’s set that aside for now. What is very clear about Lil Nas X is that he’s a combo of things that we didn’t really have before and he’s combined them well. And so hence a juggling bear.

A related theory I have about juggling bears is that they often work because they appeal to two or more markets simultaneously, giving them a larger base to work off of. And so not only do rappers like Nas but also the country music market is into him as well.
