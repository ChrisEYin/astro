When people nowadays ask me about crypto, I tell them that I’m not only a believer, but that I’ve been taking steps to exit our existing financial system and move everything I have into crypto.

On the Bankless pod they commonly say “we’re heading out west” at the end of the show. And that has stuck in my mind — from being deep in crypto over the last few months, the one thing that is really clear is that this is the way forward. It’s still really expensive to use, pretty confusing/clunky, and overall the UX is really bad. But also you can tell that at a very fundamental level this model has all of the key attributes of a “big thing”. It’s a complete different tech game, incumbents can’t compete on this plane, it seems like a toy solving a narrow use case, it’s a completely different set of folks using this, and the last generation of successful folks are brushing it under the rug.

It’s really quite an exciting time. Chris Dixon put it well, saying that what makes web3/crypto such a rich canvas is that there are multiple vectors of change happening here namely across tech, business, finance, orgs, and culture. We’ve got new blockchains like Avalanche getting built, new businesses like those of automated swaps/bonds, a whole different way to doing finance with programmatic loans, novel ways or organizing with DAOs, and new cultural norms like gm/discord/memes/etc.

The only thing that does matter here is that while it’s all very messy and still very unclear how it’s going to shape up, it is the future. It won’t be for the light hearted, crypto speed is a very real thing, the money is huge, and the FOMO is omnipresent. But it is incredibly exciting and there’s no looking back. So for those who want to build the future, come out west with us!
