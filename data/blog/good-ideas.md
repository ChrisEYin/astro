summary: Good ideas are non consensus and right.

There are a number of sayings about good ideas, but one of my favorites is from [Howard Marks](https://www.amazon.com/Most-Important-Thing-Thoughtful-Publishing-ebook/dp/B004U5Q1O0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1497747460&sr=8-1&keywords=the+most+important+thing+howard+marks) about being [non-consensus and right](https://25iq.com/2014/06/14/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-from-marc-andreessen/). 

The basic idea is that if we plot ideas on a 2x2 matrix (one axis being consensus & non consensus, the other being right & wrong), the only ones that matter are those that are non consensus and right. Anything wrong is wrong. But being right and consensus is also bad — everyone already knows it, so there’s nothing interesting there. Hence the below matrix:

It's a simple insight. But it's hard to find ideas that are both non-consensus and right. Not only are they hidden, but by definition it will look sound silly at first. As [Chris Dixon](https://twitter.com/cdixon) said, the [next big thing will start out looking like a toy](https://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy).

A pursuit that strikes me as similar is that of an investigative journalist. Pieces like the [Harvey Weinstein story](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories) and the [Nixon story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gop-security-aide-among-five-arrested-in-bugging-affair/2012/06/07/gJQAYTdzKV_story.html?utm_term=.ebe6f43f0e29) share a similar arc as many successful startups. 

In both cases the stories went against the existing narrative, but ultimately turned out to be true. The writers started off with a nagging suspicion about something and then chased it down. They found a thread and pulled on it until it unwound. It wasn't always the same idea they started with nor did they know where it was going, but they kept pulling at it until the truth came out.

Good startups ideas share a similar path. Paypal started out by trying to [beam IOUs across palm pilots](https://www.fastcompany.com/1837839/reid-hoffman-paypals-pivoted-path-success). Instagram started out as a [location sharing network](https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/08/instagram-a-pivotal-pivot/). Twitter started as a [podcasting network](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-twitter-was-founded-2011-4). All of them started with building something non-obvious and kept pulling on the thread until they found a deep truth. 

So a way to think about good startup ideas is like trying to write an expose. Start with a suspicion, work your sources and chase down the facts. Keeping pullig the thread regardless of where it may lead you and in that pursuit, you may discover something interesting. And if that interesting thing is both non-consensus and right, you may have a good startup idea.
