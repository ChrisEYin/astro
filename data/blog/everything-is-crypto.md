Crypto has always been different. Most industries (ie startups from Silicon Valley, finance on Wall Street, etc) all have a certain style, standard, culture, or decorum to them. They're often led by people that come from similar places (ie Stanford, Harvard, etc) and so it's no wonder they all have a certain feel to them.

But not crypto. The origins of crypto -- the bottoms up, anonymous, and ragtag nature of early people meant there were no rules. Plus the global, 24x7, and open philosophy of crypto meant that crypto culture originated from anywhere, anytime, and spread everywhere instantly. Everything about crypto was different. Our values (wagmi, hfsp), how we built/ran companies (protocols, daos), who our heroes were (hayes, cz), etc. Even [our language is different](https://x.com/bigdsenpai/status/2020657663491584375).

Now you are seeing crypto culture show up everywhere. Simple things like foundations (openai, openclaw), discord / community (midjourney), even the just the word "token" ([Ribbit's Token Letter](https://docsend.com/view/hcv2rx2cq7hamv4f)). But also less good things like hollow logo x logo announcements ([openai x oracle](https://x.com/ArthurMacwaters/status/1972175191062335751)), fake/botted metrics, coordinated influencer/KOL campaigns on Twitter, etc.

I remember thinking this had turned when I started seeing all the AI companies rip the crypto startup fundraise announcement where you [list every investor on a card](https://x.com/mnaficy/status/1839342011788439580) like it's a flyer for a music festival. Many other crypto native fundraise things like raising multiple rounds at different prices all at the same time, summing up total raise on announcement vs. latest raise amount, announcing valuation vs. raise amount, etc all seem to have been popularized.

And it's not just AI startups. The financial markets also seem to have become crypto. We saw a hint of this a few years ago with memestocks like AMC, GME, etc. But now huge companies are partnering with random celebs to pump their price (shoutout [Sydney Sweeney](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/09/04/american-eagle-shares-surge-30-after-sydney-sweeney-ad/)), markets / companies have full ported [narrative over fundamentals](https://x.com/fchollet/status/1623527668229767169), and most notably [public equities](https://x.com/spencer/status/1494736426352664583) and even things like [Gold, Silver, Copper, etc](https://x.com/alanbwt/status/2017075550762979623) are all insane and trading like shitcoins.

Ironically one of things least like crypto now is crypto. We're now openly working with governments on regulation, encouraging more and more TradFi folks to come in, etc. We also seem to care less than ever about the original principles of crypto -- permissionless, trustless, censorship resistant technology. We've gone from trying to eliminating the middlemen to welcoming them in and [hoping they save crypto](https://x.com/malekanoms/status/2013690074777473259).

I'm not yet sure if this is good or bad. Intuitively it feels like a good thing. We are now expanding from beyond our small, isolated world and now integrating the rest of the world into it. And so we have an opportunity to not only upgrade the world but also define how it all works. Ideally we do this in the way that made crypto great -- open, global, bottoms up -- and not just replicate the old thing but on new rails. Hopefully we don't squander it.
