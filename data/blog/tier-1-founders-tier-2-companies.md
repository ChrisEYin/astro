To start with something a bit salacious — I’ve never met a *great* founder that was a former Google or Facebook employee. I know there are a bunch of good companies that came from those places. But imo the great ones don’t come from tier 1 companies, they come from tier 2 companies.

There was an A&Z clubhouse talk the other day and I think it was Ben who said something like - “working at sales in facebook isn’t real selling, that’s just order taking.” I wholeheartedly believe that. When you are the winner in the market, your worldview is distorted. It’s easier to grow, raise money, hire people, launch products, etc when you are the market leader. It’s almost like being the hot girl at school who is completely out of touch with reality bc the world bends to her every whim. That’s what being the market winner is like. The only difference is that in startups, customer don’t care how “hot” you are. Everyone becomes ugly at some point and you need to be able to make it out of that.

That’s not to say there are no good founders from those companies. For example dev tools/infrastructure founders are usually pretty good coming from those companies because they’ve been on the front lines of building new things to help with scaling. So they’re in the lucky position to both be on the front lines with direct experience and as well as having been the customer/user. Also the early people are usually quite good too. But if it’s a tier 1 company, those early ppl are likely rich af now and no longer good founder material.

The best founders that I’ve met come from places that got close to the stars but didn’t quite get there. Paypal (even though it worked was a grind), Yahoo, etc. I think those are great employee networks and the founders that I’ve met from there are grinders and hustlers. They’ve had to struggle, work hard, and have dealt with the bitter taste of failure. So they’re smart, experienced, driven, and have a chip on their shoulder.

I was recently speaking with a well known founder who had previously hired a bunch of uber folks and he said “they didn’t know anything about finding pmf, they only knew how to scale something”. I’ve had the exact same experience with folks not only from Google, Facebook, etc but also with newer companies like Slack, Dropbox, etc. I’ve spoken to PMs from both of those companies who felt like they had no idea why the businesses worked and also said everything they ever worked on failed. These founders have both lacked the core skills of being a founder (finding PMF) but also a softer skill that imo matters just as much if not more — real grit to make it through tough situations.

Conversely if you look at Yahoo they have a ton of famous founders. There is the famous Brian Acton tweet about getting rejected from Facebook after he left Yahoo before then going on to build WhatsApp. Stewart was from Yahoo before he started Slack. Chad Dickerson was at Yahoo before he joined Etsy. Cloudera came out of Yahoo as well. Another more recent example is Zenefits. Rippling, AgentSync, Zerodown, etc all came from Zenefits alums. When you meet these founders they are just different. They have the spark and the “juice” to get it done. They went through a tough experience, worked their asses off, watched friends get rich while they didn’t, and yet still want to do it again. Those are the founders that make it and I’ll back those folks all day.
