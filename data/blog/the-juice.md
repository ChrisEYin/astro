what is the juice? i find myself using this more and more to define great founders but also the main thing im looking for when i meet people. and i figured i should try to write it out bc tbh im not even sure i know what it is. i just know when i see it.

the most important thing i think a founder needs is the juice. the juice is that x factor — where they have a magnetic energy, they can sell you the dream, and when you are with them, you just want to buy whatever they’re selling.

the reason juice is important is that ultimately founders are builders of communities. and you need to get people to follow you in order go build anything of value. and in todays world when things are crazy and everyone is a founder, and you can’t stand out then you’re fucked from the get go. you’ll never be able to recruit, build a big team, lead people, etc.

so it’s hard to explain what is the juice. it’s not just the ability to sell. that is one obvious manifestation of it, but if you’re an engineer and you’re famous for building amazing products and people follow you because of it, that’s enough too. it’s something along the lines of that colin powell quote that you can get people to follow you even if only out of curiosity.

one interesting aspect of this is that if you focus on juice alone, then one of my contentions are that it is actually really hard to tell a scam artist from a success story.they both look and feel the same in the beginning, and only later can you tell who is who. but my opinion is that when you meet someone with the juice, you shoudl back them regardless of what you think it is. the truth is that you cant tell and in order to just catch a founder with juice its worth funding 20 scam artists.
