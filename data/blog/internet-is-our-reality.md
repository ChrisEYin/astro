A few things have happened over the last few weeks that have left a lot of people (including me) astounded. The capital insurrection and the entire GME saga being two that really came to mind.

The question that I’ve continued to ask myself is — how can this have happened? In both cases what happened seemed so untethered from reality that it was hard to wrap my mind around. The defining moment imo was an interview with a woman at the insurrection who said, “I didn’t realize that storming the capital might land me in jail.” Wait, what?

What I’ve realized is that it’s not actually that dumb if you look at it in a different way. The primer is that first off -- our world had dramatically changed. The plane of attention has shifted away from the physical world to the internet. This was already true for lots of us, but with the COVID lockdowns this became more pronounced. For GME/insurrection folks, the physical world wasn't their reality; Reddit became their reality.

If we zoom out, this has been happening for some time already. If think think about a sliding scale with the physical world on one end and the digital world on the other, we've been slowly shifting over towards digital for the last 20 years. And being stuck at home all day with no outside interaction was the tipping point for many folks.

That’s not to say the physical world is done. But we've shut off all the physical world sensory inputs and simultaneously dialed up our digital inputs up to 1000 all in a matter of days. And that has done weird things to our collective psyche. With everybody freaking out, nobody knowing what's going on, the government spewing out all kinds of nonsense, people didn't know where to turn. And in that vacuum, the screen became our god.

The implications are enormous. It is a fundamental untethering from what has been considered classic the "truth". It's both awesome and scary -- a lot of the classic insitutions didn't deserve the title and were reckless with the responsibility. But there were also a lot of good ones, or at the very least non malicious ones. And now we're in the wild west of the internet first age where anything goes.

The good news is we now have the opportunity to rebuild our institutions in a digitally native way. We have a chance to wipe the slate clean and do it right this time. But it's also horrifying because there are both good and bad guys in the wild west. And in the last few weeks we've seen what the bad guys can do. There are more bening new realities like WSB, but also more terrifyines ones like QAnon.

I've been wondering if this stays true post-pandemic. If we think about our brains as simple machines we are currently very starved for real-life physical inputs and very over-indexed on online inputs. When we go back into the real world on a regular basis and we rebalance those 2, do we forget our time in the wild west?

I’m not sure, but I doubt it. It feels like the tide has shifted. The government has done such a poor job of managing & communicating what is going on re: the pandemic that one of the few universally agreed upon truths left is that these institutions are rife with incompetency and we cannot fully trust them. The government has not only failed to help us, in many instances they were actively harming us.

My bet is that while there is still some time before the internet permanently becomes our full time God, the shift is real and we’ve already tipped. Real world inputs are very powerful and as we get back outside, folks will be forced to see things for what they are instead of staying stuck in their own internet bubble which will be a healthy injection into the system. But by now we’ve gotten the taste for it and we can’t put the genie back in the bottle. Not to mention that tech is only improving which will continually make the online inputs that much stronger.

I’m still thinking about what the takeaways are. I think there are likely several here, but the first one that comes to mind is what I’m calling “being good at being internet first”. I think being able to shift your thinking towards an internet first world can be useful in thinking about how individuals and markets will behave & interact in the future.
