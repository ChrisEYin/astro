The last few weeks have been insane and left me in a bit of shock. The insurrection on the capital & the entire GME saga are two good examples. I look at both of those and think - what the hell happened there??

One moment that stood out to me was from an interview with a woman who flew into the insurrection on a private jet. After she got arrested and let out on bail she told the press she "didn’t realize that storming the capital might land me in jail.” *me watching*: __???__

It was tough for me to to understand. How could she not have known it was illegal to physically break into federal offices? We didn't get much else on her but outside of that in the interview she seemed lucid and at least somewhat aware of the real world? 

When I looked at her situation through the lens of the real world, she seemed insane. But turns out she was a QAnon. And putting on the QAnon perspective  helped it make more sense. Of course she thought she was immune from legal trouble, QAnons thought they were getting these messages from Trump himself & so worst case he could always pardon them. So breaking in felt like no big deal. 

We've been slowly spending more time online over the years, building our own online communities & forming own online identities. And those online identities and offline identities are merging together. By now most people spend their waking lives online in some fashion. Working in Google Docs, meeting on Zoom, chatting in Slack, Facetiming friends, scrolling TikTok, watching Netflix. We spend more time online than not.

So it's no surprise that for some people, their whole world is more online than offline. Their communities, identity, philosophy, understanding of the world, etc all come from the internet. For some people, the internet is their God. And when those people live in toxic online communities like QAnon, it can go bad quickly.

Then add covid to the mix. We went from slowly marching towards an online-dominant world to then all of a sudden everyone dialing it up to 1000 all at the same time. Our brains were just not ready for that level of online especially that quickly, and I think there are still repercussions to come.

That's why I've never understood people who talk about "the metaverse" in future tense. We're already here, the UI just isn't very good yet. Most people are already living in an online-dominant world, we just don't navigate through some 3d world in an animated avatar. Instead we jump from website to website on a browser or on a phone and interact with our digital worlds that way. Like if Twitter were a digital world, I'd be on that planet a lot.

I don't know all the ramifications, but it is really cool seeing these internet-native communities rise with their own cultures, styles, and perspectives. And as our collective online & offline cultures continue to blend, internet-native groups can begin to really exert their influence not only online but also in the real world. And it's hard to see how internet-native communities don't end up the more powerful one.

Obviously this can go bad (ie QAnon), but like anything it can be used for both positive and negative. There are tons of interesting ways this can take shape and I see a lot of amazing ways this can be help make people's lives better. Software has been shown to allow far more creativity than classic meatspace and it will be really exciting to see what we build from here.
