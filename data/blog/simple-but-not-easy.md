summary: Many seemingly complex things are actually pretty straightforward. But that doesn't mean it's easy.

One thing about giving advice is that it's often pretty easy to see what someone else should be doing when you're on the outside. When you're on the outside there are no emotions involved, it's often pretty easy to zoom out, see the bigger picture, and chart a pretty clear path from current situation to end goal.

On the other side when you're in the situation it's never that clear. You are finely attuned to all the emotions of the situation, you actually feel the stakes, and it's easy to get lost in the noise. 

When I'm in these situations one of the things that I end up saying a lot to the receivers of this advice are that it's actually "simple, but not easy". It's one of those things that sounds good but might not actually mean anything. 

But what this really means is that often the answer to a problem is actually very easy. If you zoom out enough you tend to already know what to do. I remember when we were at Rainforest and we did all the things to try to save the business. But zooming out I knew what we needed to do -- we needed to fire a bunch of people and restart the business over. Simple, but not easy to do. 

It turns out a lot of other things in life are like this as well. You want to get healty? Eat right and work out everyday. Simple, but not easy. You want to get rich? Work hard and keep trying. Simple, but not easy. 

When you're in the heat of the moment it can be really hard to see the forest from the trees. But when you zoom out, it's easy to see. But that doesn't mean that it's easy to do.
