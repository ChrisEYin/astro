I used to be a big inbox zero guy. I would make a note to respond to everyone as soon as I got their message across email, text, etc. As I started working more, the volume of messages that I got exponentiated. And I realized that while the volume of messages I could get was infinite, my time was fixed. 

I listened to this [PandoMonthly with Chris Sacca](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqUG2_cmZ6I) and he mentioned this concept of offense vs. defense. It led to this quote:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/sealfur?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@sealfur</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sacca?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@sacca</a> I said: “Your email inbox is a to-do list everyone can add to.” Heavily influenced by <a href="https://twitter.com/gtdguy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GTDguy</a>&#39;s book of course.</p>&mdash; Jason Shellen (@shellen) <a href="https://twitter.com/shellen/status/228202415789334528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2012</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I've remembered this ever since. And it's not just email, but any comms tool. Responding to messages over email, slack, text, etc can make you feel productive but ultimately just distract you. It means you are doing other people's work, not your own. 

Living this way means you are playing defense, not offense. The way to make sure that you achieve what you want to achieve is by ruthlessly prioritizing and ensure that you are spending your time working on things that push your goals forward. Make sure you play offense with your time.

On the other side of this, you can't live in a vacuum and only do what you want to do. There are things you have to respond to and people you should get back to without it having to be on your list of top priorities. 

But too often I see people who live in email, slack, whatsapp, telegram, etc. I think it's good to maintain a list of topics and people to respond to prioritize. For everything else, it should come after your own list.
