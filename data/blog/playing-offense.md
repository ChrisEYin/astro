I used to be a big inbox zero guy. I would make a note to respond to everyone as soon as I got their message across email, text, etc. As I started working more, the volume of messages that I received exponentiated. And I realized that while the volume of messages I could get was infinite, my time was fixed. 

I loved [PandoMonthly](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pandomonthly) back in the day and remember the [Chris Sacca](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqUG2_cmZ6I) talk where he mentions this in the context of email:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/sealfur?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@sealfur</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sacca?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@sacca</a> I said: “Your email inbox is a to-do list everyone can add to.” Heavily influenced by <a href="https://twitter.com/gtdguy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GTDguy</a>&#39;s book of course.</p>&mdash; Jason Shellen (@shellen) <a href="https://twitter.com/shellen/status/228202415789334528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2012</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I've remembered this ever since. It's not just email or other comms tools, but ita applies to everything. Responding to messages, clearing our requests from others, etc can make you feel productive, but ultimately they just distract you from your actual goals. You are doing other people's work, not your own. 

Living this way means you are playing defense, not offense. You'll wake up one morning and realize you've helped a lot of other people get to where they want to go while forgetting about what's most important - getting to where you want to go.

The way to avoid that is you want to ruthlessly prioritize and ensure that you are spending your time working on things that push your goals forward. Other stuff can wait - make sure you are first playing offense with your time before you help others.

Now in practice you can't live in a vacuum and only do what you want to do. You often have to help others in order to help yourself as well. So this is not to say ignore everyone and only focus on yourself. It's just that most people like to be helpful and can easily slip into an defense-first posture vs. prioritizing offense and keeping both in balance.
