One of the questions I spend the most time on when meeting new companies is around "why now". What has changed in the world that has made this the right opportunity to attack right now?

In my view this is easily one of the most important questions when looking at a new opportunity. And the quality of the answer can be the difference betweeen a good and a great company. Yet I’m still surprised how often founders seem unprepared or have unsatisfactory answers to this.

Take telemedicine as a category. One of the first entrants in this category is a company called [Teladoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teladoc_Health) back in 2002. It was a sleepy company that raised $100M+ over 13 years to take the company public in 2015. And after all that time and money invested, at the time of IPO they only had [$43M in revenue a $600M market cap](https://rockhealth.com/deconstructing-teladoc-ipo-s-1/). And while they ultimately got to a good outcome, it sounded like a slog. Lots of little acquisitions, tons of effort lobbying and dealing with state by state regulations, etc. Not a compelling "why now" back then.

Contrast that to today where we have a number of telemedicine companies that are growing at breakneck speeds. [Hims](https://www.forhims.com/) got started in 2017 and within 2 years got to [$100M in recurring revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/17/hims-aims-to-raise-200-million-as-sales-of-mens-health-products-grow.html) and forecasting $250M in 2020. [Nurx](https://www.nurx.com/) got started in 2015 and as of mid last year already has [200k patients and growing 20% MoM](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/birth-control-delivery-startup-nurx-approaches-300m-valuation/) and valued at over $300M. [Lemonaid Health](https://www.lemonaidhealth.com/) and others have similar growth stories.

The "why now" is much more compelling for this cohort of companies — the proliferation of mobile phones, new demographics in play, the popularity of on demand and D2C services, etc. And this is before COVID-19, which now is pushing these companies to even greater heights. Solv shared that they [grew 3400%](https://medium.com/solv/the-rise-of-telemedicine-how-covid-19-is-fundamentally-changing-healthcare-for-all-of-us-ad153eb43839) over the last month and AliPay in China had [300M patients](https://twitter.com/Alipay/status/1230473712719130626?s=20) use their service in March.

So spend the time to think really think about through the "why now" question. And this isn’t just for investors — be brutally honest with yourself about what a real trend is. Lots of on demand services got started in the last decade, but there’s only one Uber. And I’m sure that many of the "why now" slides for both successful and failed ones are similar. So spend the time to figure out what is real for your startup.
