One of the questions I spend the most time on when meeting new companies is around "why now". I don't believe there are new ideas. The only question is timing. What has changed in the world that makes this idea viable right now vs. any other point in history?

The answer can be the difference betweeen a good company but was a slog and a great company that seems to be up only. Yet given the importance I’m still surprised how often founders don't seem to have thought this through.

Take telemedicine as a category. One of the first entrants in this category is a company called [Teladoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teladoc_Health) back in 2002. It was a sleepy company took over 13 years and had to raise over \$100M to go public. And even  after all that time and money, at IPO they still only had [\$43M in revenue and a \$600M market cap](https://rockhealth.com/deconstructing-teladoc-ipo-s-1/). While that's not a failure, it sure sounds like a slog - a lot of money and effort for a so so outcome. Directionally right, but wrong timing. There wasn't a a compelling "why now" back then.

Contrast Teladoc's story to telemedicine startups today. There are a bunch of telemedicine startups growing at insane speeds. [Hims](https://www.forhims.com/) got started in 2017 and within 2 years got to [\$100M in recurring revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/17/hims-aims-to-raise-200-million-as-sales-of-mens-health-products-grow.html) and forecasting \$250M in 2020. [Nurx](https://www.nurx.com/) got started in 2015 and as of mid last year already has [200k patients and growing 20% MoM](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/birth-control-delivery-startup-nurx-approaches-300m-valuation/) and valued at over \$300M. [Lemonaid Health](https://www.lemonaidhealth.com/) and others have similar growth stories. It took Hims 2 years to get more than double the revenue Teladoc had in 13 years.

And it's because the why now is much more compelling for this cohort of companies. The proliferation of mobile phones, new demographics in play, the popularity of on demand and D2C services, etc. And this is before COVID-19, which now is pushing these companies to even greater heights. Solv shared that they [grew 3400%](https://medium.com/solv/the-rise-of-telemedicine-how-covid-19-is-fundamentally-changing-healthcare-for-all-of-us-ad153eb43839) over the last month and AliPay in China had over [300M patients](https://twitter.com/Alipay/status/1230473712719130626?s=20) use their service in March.

So it's worth really thinking through why now. And this isn’t just for investors — be brutally honest with yourself about what is a real trend is and what isn't. There's only one Uber, but there are thousands of dead bodies in the on demand startup world. And I'm sure their why now slides all looked the same. So spend the time to figure out what is real for your startup before you bet the farm.
