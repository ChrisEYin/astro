A concept that stuck with me from reading Alex Danco’s excellent Emergent Layers series was that of scarcity, abstraction & abundance. If you haven’t read the series, you should stop and go do that.

But the tl;dr is this – money is typically made at points of friction. These points of friction are often scarce resources. Great technologies abstract these scarce resources away and make them abundantly available.

He mentions a few notable examples in technology – Intel abstracted away microprocessors by making them programmable, resulting in abundantly available computing power. Microsoft abstracted away the machinery behind the PC by creating the software layer to easily operate the machinery. Cisco abstracted away the complexity of networking and made connectivity abundantly available. Google made information on the internet abundantly available, and Facebook your social graph.

So the framework is scarcity to abstraction to abundance.

In How We Got to Now, the author reviews 6 major innovations and the subsequent hummingbird effects through time. While reading this, I found several examples following the framework above. So figured I would share a few.

Temperature

In the early 1900’s, summer was a grueling time. People struggled with the heat. To cope they’d drink iced beverages, play in the water, or even ride the train aimlessly to try and keep cool. The heat made several activities impractical (ie watching a movie in a hot small theater for a few hours), eating certain foods were horrible, and living was just generally uncomfortable. A more liveable temperature was the scarce resource.

And so in 1902, Willis Carrier invented the air conditioner. The air conditioner changed the game and made local temperature control an abundant resource. Both commercial & residential areas now could change the temperature to whatever they desired by fiddling with a thermostat.

The results were profound. Not only is the Carrier Corporation is still the top air conditioning company over 100 years later ($12.5 billion revenue, 45k+ employees in 2012), but it opened up huge areas that were previously uninhabitable. Tucson went from 45k to 210k inhabitants in just 10 years. And Florida became one of the top 4 most populous areas in the world, growing from less than 1 million to 10 million people in less than 50 years.

Light

Before the late 1700’s, the dark consumed the bulk of people’s lives. People planned their days around the sun and used candles at night to try and illuminate the darkness. Life was generally more dangerous at night and with no street lights, crime was high. People also slept very differently – often over a 12+ hour period in 2 separate sessions.

Light was the scarce resource for the people of the late 1700’s. And so in the 1793, William Murdoch invented the gas lamp. By 1807, the first public gas lamp was lit in the streets of London. Crime went down, factories could stay open longer, and people could be awake for more hours in the day. The gas lamp made light abundantly available to the people. About a century later, Thomas Edison would commercialize the electric lighting system and subsequently created General Electric, still one of the largest companies in the world.

Time

We take time today for granted. Buses, trains, coordinating schedules, etc all depend on a synchronized time system. But before the 1600’s, we used a combination of sundials & mechanical clocks. The clocks had to be recalibrated several times a day to stay just somewhat accurate. Time was not measured in seconds & hours, but in hours & days.

This became a real problem for those sailing across oceans. Determining your location at sea is based longitude / latitude. Latitude you can determine from the sky, but longitude is based on a system timing and subtracting from two clocks. With clocks wildly inaccurate, you can’t tell where you are, which is a problem when you’re in the middle of the ocean.

And so in the early 1600’s Galileo invented the basis for the pendulum clock (finished by Christiaan Huygens in 1650). The pendulum clock was vastly superior to anything at the time and the most accurate system in the world for almost 300 years (until ~1930ish). This made time measurable and accurate to the second, only losing 1 sec / week (as opposed to the historical 20 min / day). The dramatic increase in the accuracy of keeping time made doing anything based on time – measuring performance, managing work schedules, meeting people, etc – actually feasible. It made accurate time keeping abundantly available for the people.

So a few examples of technologies that took something very scarce, abstracted them away and made them abundantly available (to the point we take most today for granted).
