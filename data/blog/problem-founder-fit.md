Early stage investing is hard. Who would’ve known that a taxi cab over the phone app would become Uber, or that a MMORPG company would become Slack?

Predicting the future is hard and only fools claim to be able to do it successfully. But that is the nature of early stage investing, you’re supposed to be able to see the future and bet on it.

But I've come to think that's not not actually the truth. I think early stage investing is much more about betting on people than betting on the future. It’s tough to figure out the future and it’s much easier to bet on a person who can build the future.

When you hear about what people invest in, you often hear it’s a mix of team, market, or growth. I think there's a spectrum — early stage is team, venture is market, and late stage is about growth (aka financials).

Early stage investing is all about betting on the people. Ideas change, markets change, but the people don’t. Not to mention that markets are hard to size in the beginning. Anyone can do a bottoms up analysis of the market opportunity. But the best companies don’t fit neatly into existing markets, they create new ones. I’ve been misled by market size concerns more than a few times and have been wrong.

So while you have to consider the market, when you meet a great founder in the early stage and the market is directionally right, then bet on it. And a ‘great’ founder imo is all about problem founder fit.
