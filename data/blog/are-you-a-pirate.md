This post from Mike Arrington is one of my favorite posts ever written. This quote always gets me:

“When I talk to non-entrepreneurs about the startup world I often use a pirate analogy. Not because I know that much about pirates, but the general stereotypes work well as an analogy.

Why did some people way back in the 17th century, or whenever, become pirates? The likely payoff was abysmal, I imagine. There’s a very small chance you’d make a fortune from some prize, and a very large chance you’d drown, or be hung, or shot, or whatever. And living on a small ship with a hundred other guys must have sucked, even for the captain.

But in my fantasy pirate world these guys just had really screwed up risk aversion algorithms. Unlike most of the other people they actually lusted after that risk. The potential for riches was just an argument for the venture. But the real payoff was the pirate life itself.”

There’s a tone about the piece that I don’t love (the we’re better than you vibe), but it’s such a great encapsulation of what it is to be a founder. It’s about loving something and willing to give it all for it, it’s about working day and night for nothing, but all while having an absolute blast doing it. I think about this a lot and it definitely helps when things are rough.

I wonder for me and the others if it’ll ever not be like this. Will we give up the life at some point for something more stable? And if we do will we look back fondly but realize it’s in the past or will we always lust for more? I have no idea but I really hope the desire to say fuck it and risk it all never goes away.

“I don’t care if you’re a billionaire. If you haven’t started a company, really gambled your resume and your money and maybe even your marriage to just go crazy and try something on your own, you’re no pirate and you aren’t in the club.

That thrill of your first hire, when you’ve convinced some other crazy soul to join you in your almost certainly doomed project. The high from raising venture capital and starting to see your name mentioned in the press. The excitement of launch and…gulp…customers! and the feeling of truly learning something useful, you’re just not sure what it is, when the company almost inevitably crashes and burns.”
