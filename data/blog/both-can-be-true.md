I’ve had this idea in my head for awhile and have been unable to figure out how to articulate it well. Saw this tweet from Parker tonight and figured I would give it a shot again.

Let’s start small. The thing Parker is referencing is a tweet from Taylor Lorenz saying something like ‘online harassment has ruined her life’. A lot of people agreed, and a lot of people didn’t. Tom’s tweet above was a comment on that situation.

What Twitter does exceptionally well is shed any hint of nuance. It’s hard to convey complex ideas in 280 characters. And so what you get are a lot of very strongly worded one-sided opinions. Look at Taylor’s favorites for one side and then look up Glen Greenwald for the other. Both sides are absolutely convinced they are right and that the other side is completely wrong. Nobody is listening to anybody.

While it makes for good Twitter banter, I hate this about modern discourse. The fact is that the world is just more complicated than that. It’s not as simple as one side is right and the other is wrong — in fact both things can be different, even opposing, but still true at the same time.

Are men who love to shit on Taylor and harass her total fucking assholes? Absolutely! Is Taylor also playing a victim and being a hypocrite? Also yes! Both can be true at the same time. That’s what Parker is highlighting above.

It doesn’t mean that we should get to blindly shit on Taylor, far from it. The people who constantly taunt and harass her online like Balaji are disgusting, honestly get a fucking life. But it also does not mean that just b/c people are mean to her online that she is exempt from criticism. She has been hypocritical and has refused to own up to it. Taylor can be a hypocritical person and tech bros can also be total assholes at the same time. They are not mutually exclusive ideas.

Again, this is not about tech vs. media or Taylor vs. a bunch of dudes. I don’t give two shits about those things. I’m just using the latest division to highlight a concept that I think is really important yet missing from so many of both my online and irl interactions. Two conflicting ideas can be true at the same time.

Getting out of gossip, I thought Amjad of Replit had a good tweet about this. He called it the Innovator’s Duality:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Entrepreneurship is full of tensions. I call this The Innovator’s Duality:<br><br>- naively optimistic YET product realist<br>- visionary AND incremental<br>- focused YET ambitious <br>- passionate YET measured<br>- cares about customers AND ignores detractors<br><br>What else?</p>&mdash; Amjad Masad ⠕ (@amasad) <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1365778571126468612?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The basic idea is that as an entrepreneur you need to believe in two conflicting ideas at the same time. When you’re starting up, you have so much going against you. You’re lacking resources, time, money, and most people are probably telling you you’re crazy. Yet the best founders carry on even with that in their heads.

You have to be a bit crazy to do that. And there is a fine line between good crazy and bad crazy. Good crazy is the founder who sells a bit ahead of roadmap but then comes back after and works their ass off to make it real. Bad crazy is the founder who believes their own bullshit so much they go from selling a bit ahead to fraud (see Theranos and others for examples). To be successful as a founder, you have to have both — infinite optimism and realism at the same time.

I think this is broader than just being a founder. I think that being good at anything requires this attitude. You have to optimistic yet realistic. You have to listen to others but also follow your vision. You have to work hard yet know when to relax. You need to be able to hold multiple contradictory viewpoints in your head simultaneously and then use them as they come up.

To end, I like the way Kanyi said this awhile back:
