Something I've been thinking about a lot recently is the concept of one way vs. two way doors. I first heard of this from one of Jeff Bezos's Amazon [shareholder letters](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm):

> Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible – one-way doors – and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that – they are changeable, reversible – they’re two-way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups.

This simple idea makes a lot of sense. Basically don't rush into anything that can't be undone; and don't over deliberate what can be undone. 

What isn't so simple is figuring out if a decision is a one way or a two way door. Unfortunately I don't have any great insight on how to tell the difference. But what I have found helpful is simply remembering to consider this framing before any serious decision helps avoid making obvious mistakes.
