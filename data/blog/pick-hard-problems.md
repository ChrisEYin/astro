summary: The effort to solve difference between good and great problems is marginal, so pick hard problems.

I feel like more and more friends of mine are thinking about starting new companies. Maybe it’s just that everyone has more time to think and talk about it now, but it does genuinely feel like there are more people than ever thinking about building "their own thing".

Sometimes I think about entrepreneurs and see the different levels in this game. On one end newer founders work on things like building basic SaaS apps to just spit off some MRR. And on the other end seasoned founders raise a ton to work on things like space or climate change.

The mistake I often see new founders make is focusing on problems that are ‘too small’. And that isn’t meant to be a value statement. It just means that I think that starting & building companies is hard. No matter what you work on, you have to give it your all to make it work. I’ve seen people running restaurants who have to work just as hard as people as startup people. And restaurants don't really pay out like startups.

Startup people have way more upside than someone who builds a restaurant. And so if you can choose, you want to work on the startup that has the potential to make you hundreds of millions of dollars in a few years rather than work on the restaurant that will most likely close in a few years.

So if the efforts are more or less fixed, make sure that you pick a problem that has the biggest potential outcome. If you’re going to give it your all, pick a problem that if you solve will give you the payout you deserve for your time. And typically bigger problems yield bigger outcomes. So you’ll put in a similar amount of effort but get a much bigger payoff from solving bigger problems than smaller ones.

Not to mention it can actually be easier to solve the bigger problems. You’ll have an easier time recruiting people, raising capital, etc. And so it’s counterintuitive, but solving bigger problems might both make you more money and be easier to accomplish than if you picked something more sensible. So whatever you’re thinking about, dial up the intensity at least a few degrees.
