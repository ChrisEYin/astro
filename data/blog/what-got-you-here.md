summary: While your current skills helped you get to where you are, they're holding you back from the next level.

Progress is hard. It doesn't matter if it's getting a new job or trying to build your company. All progress is change and unfortunately, change is hard for most humans. 

When you try to level up there are usually 2 ways to go about it. You either do what you're doing faster + better or you have to do something entirely different. I find the vast majority of people opt for the first option instead of realizing that the only path to material growth is the second option.

Growth is a cycle of first learning how to do a new thing and after you grasp it, then perfecting how you do that new thing. A new skill is unlocked and as you master it you're able to use it to either be more efficient or do something you couldn't do before. 

At a certain point when you have done this enough, you develop a sort of toolbox with these different skills & processes. And then once you have enough tools to generally navigate most situations, you begin to instinctively reach back into the toolbox vs. learning how to use new tools.

This is the point of stagnation. This is why over enough time, most folks regardless of talent or starting point can at least progress to the middle ranks just by virtue of spending time there. They become proficient in that thing and keep making their way up until you hit a ceiling of sorts.

And the point is that those tools, while instrumental in helping you get to where you are now, are actively holding you back from going further. Imagine a meter that measures the totality of your skills. When you have a low amount of skills, you can easily double, triple, or even 10x your skill set. As you accumulate more skills though, the gains become less substantial until at some point you have to do a lot just to get an incremental 1% gain.

The way to break out of this is to go back to the earlier choice - do the same thing better or do something entirely different. Optimization only gets you so far, new processes and workflows on the same toolset will only give you marginal gains. The only way to continue to get 10x gains at a higher level is to realize that you might need a new toolbox and to then go build that.

You wouldn't use the same set of tools to build a skyscraper as you would to build a house. You wouldn't use the same techniques, materials, processes, etc. You'd have to net new how to learn how to build a skycraper. So while it's comforting to reach into the same toolbox, you have to realize that by doing so you're also limiting yourself to your current stature.

The hack is that when you realize you're doing something you haven't done before, to actively forget everything you know about how to "do things". Throw it all away, focus on the goal, the constraints you have, and figure out from first principles how to tackle that. Odds are the way you accomplish said new thing will look quite different from how you accomplished prior things.
