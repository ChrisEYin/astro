summary: How to skip levels in life.

I find myself saying this to people a lot. Yet despite constantly shilling this opinion to people, I was rethinking my life last week and realized how hard it is to truly internalize this.

Progress is hard. Doesn't matter if it's getting a new job, trying to get promoted, growing your company, etc. All progress is change, and all change is hard. And while some milestones can be achieved by just working harder, I tend to think that the really big milestones only happen through a change in how you work vs. just working harder. Put another way, you can get incrementally better by working harder. But if you want to get 10x better in the same time, it's not by doing the same thing but faster. You have to do it differently.

I think what's hard with this advice is not only do you have to change, but what made you good is now actively holding you back from you getting better. For example if a software engineer is trying to become VPE, most people would know that something has to change in order to make that jump. But I think less people would realize that what made them a good software engineer actually makes them a bad VPE.

Real change is hard. Most folks can try to change by adding new behaviors/habits/etc - but shedding existing ones, especially ones that made you good is a whole different thing. You have to not only clearly assess yourself and who you are but then also have the fortitude to reassmble the core components that define you.

I’m still working through this and I definitely don’t think that I have all the answers yet. But I’m writing this down to help me come to terms with this and also as a reminder to myself that change is both hard to start and but also hard to keep going. But to get to where you want to go, you have to shed the past in order to get to the future.
