When i was getting into crypto I asked someone what to do and how to think about it. They said - “Take whatever you’re comfortable losing, triple it and ape into something. And then immediately take a loan out against that and ape again. Within a week you’ll have the whole ecosystem figured out.”

While it’s a pretty extreme example, it is useful to illustrate how learning actually works. So many folks I know say they want to learn about crypto but are wandering around aimlessly and dancing at the surface but never really getting into the meat of it all. On the other end, those of us smooth brains who aped were forced into the bowels of discord, telegram, CT, etc - mostly out of fear - but ultimately it helped us develop a real understanding of what was going on.

While the ‘skin in the game’ aphorism is generally true in anything, i find it especially true in web3. And I think the reason why it’s so important to have skin in the game to understand web3 and why so many have trouble getting involved is because getting into crypto often involves spending money. And for some reason people have a really hard time doing something new and risky when money is involved. Even if the amount of money is trivial, having to transfer money out, pay gas to move it around, and then buy something pretty nebulous is a big hurdle for a lot of people. And even if people are willing to do if all, the constant refrain I hear is that they want to make sure the first one they buy is the ‘right’ one and end up holding out longer than they need to.

So for all of my friends and the people that are trying to learn about crypto, please stop thinking for a bit, smoothen the brain out a bit and just ape. You don’t have to spend your whole net worth, you just have to spend a little bit. Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good and more importantly zoom out and look at the big picture. Even if you end up losing a bit, the entire exercise is still a huge net positive - you’ll probably not only make it all back pretty quickly, but more importantly you’ll immediately elevate yourself into the upper quartile of folks who actually who what they’re doing in crypto, you’ll have learned about how this world works and will be well equipped to jettison off into the rabbit hole that is web3.
