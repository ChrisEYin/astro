summary: How not to blow yourself up for no reason.

I was talking to a famous entrepreneur the other day and we were doing the classic intro pleasantries. One of the questions is where are you from, as always. And I said I was bouncing around SF, LA, NYC. And he said, "how about Miami?" And then I went on a long rant about Miami, specifically how I couldn't stand it, every time I go I want to get the fuck out as soon as possible, etc. Then I asked him where he was from and he laughed and said Miami.

Needless to say we didn't it off. As soon as he said "I'm from Miami" I knew I fucked up. And afterwards I checked his Twitter and it was all super pro Miami posts, a la Keith/Delian. I had completely shot myself in the foot for no reason, a classic unforced error.

The part that made the least sense to me was that I don't actually feel that strongly about Miami. I have lots of friends who live there, every time I go I have a great time, and I find the food, the culture, the weather, the lifestyle, etc all super enjoyable. I do think the Miami over eveything people are a bit strange, and I can also believe that while Miami is a great city I can also think it is full of grifters and non serious people. Both can be true.

But it was a classic example of me being super extra about something for no reason. I don't have that strong of opinions about Miami, I always enjoy going. I've met both great party people but also some great entrepreneurs down there as well. I've also met a bunch of people that I think are war criminals, hung out at E11even until 9am, and I've been to Bob's house too many times to count.

I have a history of doing this. I like controversy and I reject classic norms. I find that when I'm around super agreeable people or just those with exceedingly trad views of things, I tend to go the other way, even if I don't actually believe it. There's something about the conventional wisdom that I am simply allergic to.

And at the time I had this convo (a few months ago), I feel like the conventional view was that Miami wasn't that bad. It was a good place alongside SF, NYC, etc. and while it was smaller it there were some great people there. And so the opposing view is to be salacious and say that Miami is a trash city and I can't stand it, filled with criminals, Vegas of the East, all grifters and people dodging taxes, etc.

Again, while I do think all those things are true, that isn't my view of Miami. But that is ultimatley what I expressed and I'm sure that I burned my relationship with that guy. And for no reason at all. Like the meme - it was a calculated risk to just ran about Miami, but man am I bad at math.

I've often struggled with finding the middle ground between these two poles. When I'm uncomfortable I tend to be more quiet because I know that I have a tinge of unagreeableness and I understand the power of a good first impression or starting memory with someone new. When I'm more comfortable I tend to be more wild in my opinions and am on the edge of insulting. It is more dynamic, people tend to react better, but you need to know me to either a) not take it too seriously/personally when I say something inflammatory or b) not think I am serious and walk away thinking that I believe it.

I live by the creed, "Judge people by the actions, not words." And I really believe it. Meaning that I believe nobody should judge me by my words and instead only by my actions. The downside of this way of living though is that once you get to know me it's all good because you have enough reference points where you've seen how I act and behave and realize the inconsistency of my words but the consistency of my actions, and so those that know me tend to discount the words more which is great. But I've also realized that most people both don't operate this way but also many people you have to first break through the initial window in order to build up that history with them so they can judge you more accurately. And this is an example of failing to make it past the first test because of being extra.

I can also see the other side of this argument, which is that it's a decent filtering mechanism. Anyone who take themselves seriously to a point where they're going to judge you based on some tiny interaction is not someone worth spending time with. But I'm also a believer in keeping the top of the funnel as open as you want, and a beliver in the idea that small things can make a big difference.

I can see both sides and the ultimate takeaway from me is that the likely answer is that it's a style thing. Either can work, you just have to do what you feel more comfortable with.

But the one thing that I do belive regardless of style is that the people that I want to keep the door open to like spiky people. Or even the way that I want to represent myself is being a [spiky person](/blog/the-juice) as well. And so if that's the case, then the balance for me is likely to be spiky so that it is known but so not spiky that I alienate people. You can argue that both of these come in the same package (ie if you're a spiky person you can't become medium spiky, you just are spiky and you will ruffle some feathers). But I don't believe that, I think there are levels to it and you should respect it.
