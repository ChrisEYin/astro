I had an interesting conversation with a founder this week and he said something in our meeting that stuck with me. He said, “A company’s real workflows are not the workflows they’ve built. It’s all the stuff that falls out of those workflows.”

It’s been on my mind the last few days and the more I think about it the more I think it helps explain a lot of what is going on today in saas.

There is a finite amount of stuff that you can put into any individual workflow. When you design a process it’s impossible to capture every single thing that happens. There’s too much variance across teams, people, etc.

What you can do is standardize the big buckets of work. And so what you can do is build happy path workflows that capture the straightforward cases. Most of the saas products in use today fit this description.

But now with those workflows in place, you quickly realize that you’re now spending all of your time on all the stuff that falls out of those workflows. Because by definition all of the things that don’t fit neatly into those workflow are custom. So each thing requires new thinking every time which takes a lot of time and effort.

So the next set of companies that will matter don’t focus on work that fits neatly into predefined workflows. They’re flexible to allow you to quickly and easily build for exceptions. Products like Notion, Airtable, Retool, are good examples of tools that fill the white space in between well defined saas.

Another interesting set of companies in this world are ones like Flowdash, Macro, etc. that are built specifically for exceptions – human in the loop workflows.

And lastly for bigger companies products like Skan, Cursive, etc. help you identify both what think your processes are as well as the entire universe of exceptions that come with it. Once you know then you can decide how to solve – whether it’s through flexible tools, human + machines, or just pure automation.

Regardless of the approach, a lot of this converges on the same idea. We’ve solved generic workflows and exceptions are the next layer of work for us to tackle.
