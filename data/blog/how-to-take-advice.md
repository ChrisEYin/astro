Kristina Simmons published this post about her learnings from Khosla Ventures the other day. Worth a read, but the point that stuck out to me was this section on how to take advice:

Vinod is ruthless about who he takes advice from. He believes it’s easy to get the wrong advice. He would say this is one of the most important lessons for an entrepreneur, and most investors give advice that hurt companies rather than help. There were times I’d ask, “well, why aren’t you taking his/her advice?”, and Vinod would reply, “That’s not his/her strength.” He taught me the importance of understanding each person’s strengths and to prioritize advice based on them. Taking the wrong advice? That can be a missile to what you are building.

I see this mistake being made so often. People point to something a successful person said as a rationalization for what their actions. It reminds me of this bit from Dave Chappelle on asking Ja Rule for his thoughts on 9/11:


It’s obviously a parody of a situation (although turns out this actually happens smh), but it touches on an important point. For some reason, we love to listen to faux authority figures. And so if a famous investor says something, everyone takes it as gospel. People don’t even stop to think if the source of the advice has any relevant experience there. They could be a consumer investor talking about enterprise software and people often actually listen. Or if a famous founder who has a struggling startup but is super loud on Twitter says something, people retweet and talk about it as if it’s good advice.

What you take in ultimately becomes what you think. Opinions cost nothing and most people, especially those that have been successful in some domain, are pretty liberal with their opinions even if they have no idea what they’re talking about. Qualify advice ruthlessly and make sure that the source actually knows what they’re talking about and has demonstrated success. If you’re building a company, you should only really listen to folks who have built successful companies in that same domain. If you’re an investor, you should only listen to folks who have made money investing in your stage and your markets.

A subtler but still important point is just to qualify people on their context as well. Make sure that the person you are listening to comes from a similar background or situation. Everyone uses the tools at their disposal to get the job done. And for those who are born in a different context may have tools at their disposal that they don’t even realize others don’t have. For example I often hear people tell prospective founders quit their jobs to work on their idea and if it doesn’t work just go get another job. If you grew up really poor this advice seems ridiculous. This prospective founder may have student loans to pay off or they might be taking care of their family and send 1/2 of their paycheck back home every month. I don’t think people are being nefarious when they dispense advice like this, I just think most people don’t even realize. First most advice really has nothing to do with the receiver of said advice, they’re mostly just talking to a younger version of themselves. But even if they are actually trying to dispense real advice, they’re often just wholesale putting themselves in your situation as opposed to putting their brain in your shoes and your context.

The real takeaway here is that almost all “advice” is garbage. More often than not you’re better off listening to yourself — thinking about it, making a decision, and then dealing with the outcomes, good or bad. This way you can make sure that at the least you’re actually testing your own knowledge and you can learn and improve. Doing this over and over compounds over time and eventually you’ll get pretty good . But If you just listen to advice, the only thing you’ve learned was that it was good/bad advice, but you haven’t learned to think at all.
