Recently I've been thinking a lot about what to do in this new market and this new environment. For the entire duration of Plume, while it hasn't been that way on the inside, on the outside things generally seemed like they are only up and to the right. We've been able to fight off everything that comes to us in a negative way, we've kept our ears to the ground and moved very quickly with the market feedback.

But as with everything. things inevitably start to go wrong. And it didn't go wrong how we expected, but in some unique way that we still do not completely appreciate and understand. For some reason, our token holders turned on us at some point and created a very negative feedback loop around us.
