Hey! Thanks for stopping by. I'm Chris Yin, and this is my personal blog. It's infrequently maintained, but I do try to keep it somewhat updated.

I've done a few things, but today I am one of the founders & CEO of Plume Network, a blockchain focused on RWAs. There's a ton of stuff out there on us so I'll keep it brief -- we build a network, an ecosystem, and a blockchain focused on making it easy to interact with the real world onchain.

Before this I was in venture. I've invested from the earliest stages to the latest stages and have deployed over $100M+ into 100+ copanies. I've been lucky enough to get to invest in a few greats like Retool, WhatNot, Graphite, and many others that I'm grateful to get to learn from.

Prior to venture I was an operator, mostly in product. I've helped companies go from 0 --> 1, 1 --> 10, and 10 --> 100. I've been an IC, a manager, and an executive and was able to sell one company, take one public, and also take one to zero.

I'm all over the place nowadays but am still unfortunately irreparably stuck on Twitter still. I'm a bit backed up nowadays but please do feel free to reach out anytime!
