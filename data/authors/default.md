Hey! Thanks for stopping by. I'm Chris Yin, and this is my personal site. It's infrequently maintained, but I do try to keep it somewhat updated.

I've done a couple things, but currently I'm a cofounder & CEO of [Plume Network](https://x.com/plumenetwork). There's [a lot](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/23/plume-layer-2-blockchain-for-real-world-assets-pulls-10m-in-seed-funding-from-haun-galaxy) [of stuff](https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/12/18/tokenization-plume-funding-blockchain-fintech/) [out there](https://www.theblock.co/post/357151/plume-mainnet-150-million-real-world-assets-deployed) [on us](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/06/plume-network-registered-by-sec-as-transfer-agent-for-tokenized-securities) [already](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/17/technology/trump-crypto-unleashed.html?unlocked_article_code=1.9U8.7T3J.tzYXigtDEpdG&smid=url-share so I'll keep it brief -- we build a network, an ecosystem, and a blockchain focused on making it easy to interact with the real world onchain.

Before this I was in venture. I've invested from the earliest stages to the latest stages and have deployed over $100M+ into 100+ companies. I've been lucky enough to get to invest in a few greats like [Retool](https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/28/retool-raises-45m-at-a-3-2b-valuation-to-make-building-custom-software-as-easy-as-buying-off-the-shelf/), [Whatnot](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/business/dealbook/whatnot-livestream-shopping-fundraise.html), [Graphite](https://fortune.com/2025/12/19/cursor-ai-coding-startup-graphite-competition-heats-up/), [Hightouch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/18/hightouch-raises-80m-on-a-1-2b-valuation-for-marketing-tools-powered-by-ai/), and many others that I'm grateful to get to learn from.

Prior to venture I was an operator, mostly in product. I've helped companies go from 0 --> 1, 1 --> 10, and 10 --> 100. I've been an IC, a manager, and an executive and was able to [sell one company](https://www.coupa.com/newsroom/coupa-software-acquires-xpenser/), [help the other go public](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shares-coupa-software-coup-soar-172505349.html), and the others still live on today.

I'm all over the place nowadays but am still unfortunately irreparably stuck on [Twitter](https://x.com/chriseyin). I'm a bit backed up nowadays but please do feel free to reach out anytime!
