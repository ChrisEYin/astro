Hello! I'm Chris Yin -- 30 years old and living in the Bay Area. I'm currently an investor at [Scale Venture Partners](https://www.scalevp.com/) investing in early stage startups. Previously I was VP Product at [Rainforest QA](https://www.rainforestqa.com/), Director of Product Management at [Coupa](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coupa) and an early guy at [Xpenser](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/xpenser). I've also made a number of [angel investments](https://angel.co/chrisyin).


A little about myself -- I grew up in the Bay Area and moved down to SoCal to go to [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/). While I was there I started [a group for entrepreneurs](http://rady.ucsd.edu/ciid/pathways-ventures/) to hang out and [work](http://nextshark.com/ecoqube-how-this-startup-can-seriously-end-world-hunger/) [on fun](http://www.premedhq.com) [projects](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131030-net-lessons-for-worlds-poorest) [together](http://ivn.us/2012/12/08/locbit-young-ceo-amongst-citys-core-startups/).

After finishing undergrad, I helped start a [services firm](http://bespokepartners.com/) before joining my friend [Parand](https://twitter.com/parand) at his startup, Xpenser. In 2013 we were [acquired by Coupa](http://www.xconomy.com/san-diego/2013/04/18/acquired-or-acq-hired-xpenser-adds-expertise-to-coupas-web-services/) and I ended up as a product lead for [several](https://venturebeat.com/2016/01/28/coupas-expense-management-solution-receives-highest-score-for-proficiency/) [different](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coupa-software-unveils-inventory-application-120000580.html) [product lines](https://www.paystreamadvisors.com/2015-paystream-innovate-award-winners-announced/), ultimately helping take the company [public in 2016](https://www.businessinsider.com/coupa-ipo-is-another-smash-hit-2016-10). After that I went to Rainforest after where I ran product, design, community, support (and sales for a bit). In my spare time I helped early stage founders at companies like [Retool](https://retool.in/), [Vise](https://visea.com/), [Seldon](https://www.seldon.io/) and more with my partner [Kevin Liu](https://twitter.com/ckevinliu).

Always looking for great new people & startups to meet with, so [ping me](https://twitter.com/chriseyin/) anytime. Thanks for stopping by!
